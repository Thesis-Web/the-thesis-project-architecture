# The Thesis Project

This repository contains a **sanitized architectural overview** of a multi-layered platform designed to explore system correctness, regionalized operation, and adversarial resilience under real-world constraints.

The full implementation is maintained privately. This public repository is intended to demonstrate **design intent, architectural tradeoffs, and system reasoning**, not to serve as a deployable reference.

## Scope
- Platform-level architecture
- Regionalized system design
- Validation and attestation flows
- Failure modes and threat considerations
- Tradeoff analysis

## Non-Goals
- Production-ready code
- Token economics
- Public deployment artifacts

## Contents
See `/docs` for detailed design notes and `/diagrams` for system-level views.

## Status
Active private development. Public materials intentionally limited.
