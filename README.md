# The Thesis Project

This repository contains a **sanitized architectural overview** of a multi-layered platform designed to explore system correctness, regionalized operation, and adversarial resilience under real-world constraints.

The full implementation is maintained privately. This public repository is intended to demonstrate **design intent, architectural tradeoffs, and system reasoning**, not to serve as a deployable reference.

## Repository Structure

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
- [System Overview](docs/overview.md)
- [Threat Model](docs/threat-model.md)
- [Governance & Compliance](docs/governance-and-compliance.md)
- [Design Tradeoffs](docs/tradeoffs.md)
- [Diagram Conventions](docs/diagram-conventions.md)
- [Glossary](docs/glossary.md)

## Diagrams

- [System Context](diagrams/system-context.md)
- [Component Architecture](diagrams/component-architecture.md)
- [Data Flow](diagrams/data-flow.md)


## Scope
- Platform-level architecture
- Regionalized system design
- Validation and attestation flows
- Failure modes and threat considerations
- Tradeoff analysis

## Non-Goals
- Production-ready code
- Token economics
- Public deployment artifacts

## Contents
See `/docs` for detailed design notes and `/diagrams` for system-level views.

## Status
