# Glossary

This glossary defines terms as they are used within the context of this repository.
Definitions are scoped to architectural intent and may differ from industry colloquialisms.

---

### Component
A bounded unit of responsibility with explicit inputs and outputs. A component may be logical rather than deployable.

---

### Execution
The deterministic processing of validated inputs to produce state transitions or outputs.

---

### Validation
The process of asserting that an input or state transition satisfies required invariants before execution or commitment.

---

### Attestation
A verifiable record that a specific action or result occurred under defined conditions.

---

### Governance
The set of policies, constraints, and oversight mechanisms that influence system behavior without participating in execution.

---

### Determinism
The property that identical inputs under identical conditions produce identical outputs.

---

### Trust Boundary
A conceptual boundary beyond which assumptions about correctness, intent, or availability no longer hold.

---

### Failure Mode
A specific way in which a system or component can fail, including how that failure is detected and contained.

---

### Context
The collection of inputs, policies, and environmental assumptions required for correct operation.

---

### External Actor
Any user, system, or process outside the system’s trust boundary.
